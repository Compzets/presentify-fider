### About the app
Presentify is a macOS menu bar app that helps you give better presentations, online classes, or video tutorials by letting you annotate any screen, highlight your cursor, and more. 

In fact, you can annotate anything on screen, be it images, videos, pdfs, code, you name it. Other than annotation, it also has a cursor highlight feature where it adds a ring/circle around the mouse pointer so that it's easier for your viewers to follow you.
